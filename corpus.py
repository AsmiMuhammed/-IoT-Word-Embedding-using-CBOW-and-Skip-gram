    """
    An IoT deployment collects sensor readings such as temperature vibration and
    humidity from edge devices Data is transmitted using mqtt to a gateway then
    forwarded to a cloud dashboard for alerting and analytics Power management is
    critical for battery operated nodes so sampling rate and sleep cycles are tuned
    carefully Firmware updates must be secure to prevent device hijacking
